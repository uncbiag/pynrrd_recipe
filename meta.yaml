#
# This is how to do the build (and some other useful commands)
#
# To build requires access to the conda-forge, pytorchm and anaconda channels
# can be used with --debug flag
# conda build . -c conda-forge -c anaconda
#
# After the pacckage has build, copy it in your local directory (subdirectory osx64, for example).
# Then index it with this command (needs to be run for each subdirectory / architecture: noarch, linux-64, osx-64):
# conda index /Users/mn/PycharmProjects/tst_channel
#
# Once it is indexed it can be installed from there (ideally into a new, empty virtual environment as follows)
# conda list env
# conda activate [your_env] or conda create --name my_new_env pip python=3.7
# conda install -vv -c file://Users/mn/PycharmProjects/tst_channel/ pynrrd
# conda list
#
# Here are also some descriptions on how to host a private conda repository (as used above)

#
# to upload to the cloud
# anaconda login
# anaconda upload --user uncbiag pynrrd-0.4.0-0.tar.bz2
